When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    This is a good idea when more than one person is accessing the project, or when you are 
    working from multiple places / machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You would want to make sure that your local version is in a stable position and ready to
    receive any remote changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks only work on GitHub - they duplicate a repository in GitHub.  Clones copy a repository,
    either from GitHub or another repository, so it's a copy of a repository (that is then the
    origin).  Branching is for a repository and essentially sets up a working area that can be
    switched back to the master branch if necessary to do some maintenance on a live version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Good for travelling or otherwise being off-line.
